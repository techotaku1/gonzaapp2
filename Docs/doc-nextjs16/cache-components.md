# cacheComponents

@doc-version: 16.0.1

The `cacheComponents` flag is a feature in Next.js that causes data fetching operations in the App Router to be excluded from pre-renders unless they are explicitly cached. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of dynamic data fetching in Server Components.

It is useful if your application requires fresh data fetching during runtime rather than serving from a pre-rendered cache.

It is expected to be used in conjunction with [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache.md) so that your data fetching happens at runtime by default unless you define specific parts of your application to be cached with `use cache` at the page, function, or component level.

## Usage

To enable the `cacheComponents` flag, set it to `true` in your `next.config.ts` file:

```ts filename="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,
}

export default nextConfig
```

When `cacheComponents` is enabled, you can use the following cache functions and configurations:

* The [`use cache` directive](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache.md)
* The [`cacheLife` function](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheLife.md) with `use cache`
* The [`cacheTag` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag.md)

## Notes

* While `cacheComponents` can optimize performance by ensuring fresh data fetching during runtime, it may also introduce additional latency compared to serving pre-rendered content.

## Cache Components

@doc-version: 16.0.1

Cache Components is a new approach to rendering and caching in Next.js that provides fine-grained control over what gets cached and when, while ensuring a great user experience through **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**.

## Overview of Cache Components

When developing dynamic applications, you have to balance two primary approaches:

* **Fully static pages** load fast but can't show personalized or real-time data
* **Fully dynamic pages** can show fresh data but require rendering everything on each request, leading to slower initial loads

With Cache Components enabled, Next.js treats all routes as **dynamic by default**. Every request renders with the latest available data. However, most pages are made up of both static and dynamic parts, and not all dynamic data needs to be resolved from source on every request.

Cache Components allows you to mark data, and even parts of your UI as cacheable, which includes them in the pre-render pass alongside static parts of the page.

> **Before Cache Components**, Next.js tried to statically optimize **entire** pages automatically, which could lead to unexpected behavior when adding dynamic code.

Cache Components implements **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**, and `use cache` to give you the best of both worlds:

![Partially re-rendered Product Page showing static nav and product information, and dynamic cart and recommended products](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/learn/light/thinking-in-ppr.png)

When a user visits a route:

* The server sends a **static shell** containing cached content, ensuring a fast initial load
* Dynamic sections wrapped in `Suspense` boundaries display fallback UI in the shell
* Only the dynamic parts render to replace their fallbacks, streaming in parallel as they become ready
* You can include otherwise-dynamic data in the initial shell by caching it with `use cache`

> **🎥 Watch:** Why PPR and how it works → [YouTube (10 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTcPrTIBkpA).

## How it works

> **Good to know:** Cache Components is an opt-in feature. Enable it by setting the `cacheComponents` flag to `true` in your Next config file. See [Enabling Cache Components](#enabling-cache-components) for more details.

Cache Components gives you three key tools to control rendering:

### 1. Suspense for runtime data

Some data is only available at runtime when an actual user makes a request. APIs like [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies.md), [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers.md), and [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page.md#searchparams-optional) access request-specific information. Wrap components using these APIs in `Suspense` boundaries so the rest of the page can be pre-rendered as a static shell.

**Runtime APIs include:**

* [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies.md)
* [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers.md)
* [`searchParams` prop](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page.md#searchparams-optional)
* [`params` prop](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page.md#params-optional) - This is runtime data unless you provide at least one example value through [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params.md). When provided, those specific param values are treated as static for prerendered paths, while other values remain runtime

### 2. Suspense for dynamic data

Dynamic data like [`fetch`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch.md) calls or database queries (`db.query(...)`) can change between requests but isn't user-specific. The [`connection`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection.md) API is meta-dynamic—it represents waiting for a user navigation even though there's no actual data to return. Wrap components that use these in `Suspense` boundaries to enable streaming.

**Dynamic data patterns include:**

* [`fetch`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch.md) requests
* Database queries
* [`connection`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection.md)

### 3. Cached data with `use cache`

Add `use cache` to any Server Component to make it cached and include it in the pre-rendered shell. You cannot use runtime APIs from inside a cached component. You can also mark utility functions as `use cache` and call them from Server Components.

```tsx
export async function getProducts() {
  'use cache'
  const data = await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')
  return data
}
```

## Using Suspense boundaries

React [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) boundaries let you define what fallback UI to use when it wraps dynamic or runtime data.

Content outside the boundary, including the fallback UI, is pre-rendered as a static shell, while content inside the boundary streams in when ready.

Here's how to use `Suspense` with Cache Components:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>This will be pre-rendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
        <DynamicContent />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

async function DynamicContent() {
  const res = await fetch('http://api.cms.com/posts')
  const { posts } = await res.json()
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>This will be pre-rendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
        <DynamicContent />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

async function DynamicContent() {
  const res = await fetch('http://api.cms.com/posts')
  const { posts } = await res.json()
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}
```

At build time, Next.js pre-renders the static content and the `fallback` UI, while the dynamic content is postponed until a user requests the route.

> **Good to know**: Wrapping a component in `Suspense` doesn't make it dynamic; your API usage does. `Suspense` acts as a boundary that encapsulates dynamic content and enables streaming.

### Missing Suspense boundaries

Cache Components enforces that dynamic code must be wrapped in a `Suspense` boundary. If you forget, you'll see the [Uncached data was accessed outside of `<Suspense>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/blocking-route) error:

> **Uncached data was accessed outside of `<Suspense>`**
>
> This delays the entire page from rendering, resulting in a slow user
> experience. Next.js uses this error to ensure your app loads instantly
> on every navigation.
>
> To fix this, you can either:
>
> **Wrap the component in a `<Suspense>`** boundary. This allows Next.js to stream its contents to the user as soon as it's ready, without blocking the rest of the app.
>
> or
>
> **Move the asynchronous await into a Cache Component("use cache")**. This allows Next.js to statically prerender the component as part of the HTML document, so it's instantly visible to the user.
>
> Note that request-specific information, such as params, cookies, and headers, is not available during static prerendering, so it must be wrapped in `<Suspense>`.

This error helps prevent a situation where, instead of getting a static shell instantly, users would hit a blocking runtime render with nothing to show. To fix it, add a `Suspense` boundary or use `use cache` to cache the work instead.

### How streaming works

Streaming splits the route into chunks and progressively streams them to the client as they become ready.
This allows the user to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished
rendering.

![Diagram showing partially rendered page on the client, with loading UI for chunks that are being streamed.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

With partial pre-rendering, the initial UI can be sent immediately to the browser while the dynamic parts render. This decreases time to UI and may decrease total request time depending on how much of your UI is pre-rendered.

![Diagram showing parallelization of route segments during streaming, showing data fetching,rendering, and hydration of individual chunks.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png)

To reduce network overhead, the full response, including static HTML and streamed dynamic parts, is sent in a **single HTTP request**. This avoids extra round-trips and improves both initial load and overall performance.

## Using `use cache`

While `Suspense` boundaries manage dynamic content, the [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache.md) directive is available for caching data or computations that don't change often.

### Basic usage

Add `use cache` to cache a page, component, or async function, and define a lifetime with [`cacheLife`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife.md):

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight={1,4,5} switcher
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')
  // fetch or compute
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" highlight={1,4,5} switcher
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')
  // fetch or compute
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### Caveats

When using `use cache`, keep these constraints in mind:

#### Arguments must be serializable

Like Server Actions, arguments to cached functions must be serializable. This means you can pass primitives, plain objects, and arrays, but not class instances, functions, or other complex types.

#### Accepting unserializable values without introspection

You can accept unserializable values as arguments as long as you don't introspect them. However, you can return them. This allows patterns like cached components that accept Server or Client Components as children:

```tsx filename="app/cached-wrapper.tsx" switcher
import type { ReactNode } from 'react'
import { setTimeout } from 'node:timers/promises'

async function getSiteTitle() {
  // Simulate a slow database or API call
  await setTimeout(1000) // from 'node:timers/promises'
  return 'My Website'
}

export async function CachedWrapper({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  'use cache'
  const title = await getSiteTitle()

  // Don't introspect children, just pass it through
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/cached-wrapper.js" switcher
import { setTimeout } from 'node:timers/promises'

async function getSiteTitle() {
  // Simulate a slow database or API call
  await setTimeout(1000) // from 'node:timers/promises'
  return 'My Website'
}

export async function CachedWrapper({ children }) {
  'use cache'
  const title = await getSiteTitle()

  // Don't introspect children, just pass it through
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Tagging and revalidating

Tag cached data with [`cacheTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag.md) and revalidate it after mutations using [`updateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag.md) in Server Actions for immediate updates, or [`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag.md) delay in updates are acceptable.

#### With `updateTag`

Use `updateTag` when you need to expire and immediately refresh cached data within the same request:

```tsx filename="app/actions.ts" highlight={1,4,5,13}
import { cacheTag, updateTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function getCart() {
  'use cache'
  cacheTag('cart')
  // fetch data
}

export async function updateCart(itemId: string) {
  'use server'
  // write data using the itemId
  // update the user cart
  updateTag('cart')
}
```

#### With `revalidateTag`

Use `revalidateTag` when you want to invalidate only properly tagged cached entries with stale-while-revalidate behavior. This is ideal for static content that can tolerate eventual consistency.

```tsx filename="app/actions.ts" highlight={1,4,5,12}
import { cacheTag, revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function getPosts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheTag('posts')
  // fetch data
}

export async function createPost(post: FormData) {
  'use server'
  // write data using the FormData
  revalidateTag('posts', 'max')
}
```

For more detailed explanation and usage examples, see the [`use cache` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache.md).

## Enabling Cache Components

You can enable Cache Components (which includes PPR) by adding the [`cacheComponents`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents.md) option to your Next config file:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" highlight={4} switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,
}

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" highlight={3} switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Navigation with Cache Components

When the [`cacheComponents`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents.md) flag is enabled, Next.js uses React's [`<Activity>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity) component to preserve component state during client-side navigation.

Rather than unmounting the previous route when you navigate away, Next.js sets the Activity mode to [`"hidden"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity#activity). This means:

* Component state is preserved when navigating between routes
* When you navigate back, the previous route reappears with its state intact
* Effects are cleaned up when a route is hidden, and recreated when it becomes visible again

This behavior improves the navigation experience by maintaining UI state (form inputs, or expanded sections) when users navigate back and forth between routes.

> **Good to know**: Next.js uses heuristics to keep a few recently visited routes [`"hidden"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity#activity), while older routes are removed from the DOM to prevent excessive growth.

### Effect on route segment config

When Cache Components is enabled, several route segment config options are no longer needed or supported. Here's what changes and how to migrate:

#### `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`

**Not needed.** All pages are dynamic by default with Cache Components enabled, so this configuration is unnecessary.

```tsx
// Before - No longer needed
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export default function Page() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```tsx
// After - Just remove it, pages are dynamic by default
export default function Page() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

#### `dynamic = "force-static"`

**Replace with `use cache`.** You must add `use cache` to each Layout and Page for the associated route instead.

Note: `force-static` previously allowed the use of runtime APIs like `cookies()`, but this is no longer supported. If you add `use cache` and see an error related to runtime data, you must remove the use of runtime APIs.

```tsx
// Before
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```tsx
// After - Use 'use cache' instead
export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

#### `revalidate`

**Replace with `cacheLife`.** Use the `cacheLife` function to define cache duration instead of the route segment config.

```tsx
// Before
export const revalidate = 3600 // 1 hour

export default async function Page() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```tsx
// After - Use cacheLife
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

#### `fetchCache`

**Not needed.** With `use cache`, all data fetching within a cached scope is automatically cached, making `fetchCache` unnecessary.

```tsx
// Before
export const fetchCache = 'force-cache'
```

```tsx
// After - Use 'use cache' to control caching behavior
export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  // All fetches here are cached
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

#### `runtime = 'edge'`

**Not supported.** Cache Components requires Node.js runtime and will throw errors with [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/api-reference/edge.md).

## Before vs. after Cache Components

Understanding how Cache Components changes your mental model:

### Before Cache Components

* **Static by default**: Next.js tried to pre-render and cache as much as possible for you unless you opted out
* **Route-level controls**: Switches like `dynamic`, `revalidate`, `fetchCache` controlled caching for the whole page
* **Limits of `fetch`**: Using `fetch` alone was incomplete, as it didn't cover direct database clients or other server-side IO. A nested `fetch` switching to dynamic (e.g., `{ cache: 'no-store' }`) could unintentionally change the entire route behavior

### With Cache Components

* **Dynamic by default**: Everything is dynamic by default. You decide which parts to cache by adding [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache.md) where it helps
* **Fine-grained control**: File/component/function-level [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache.md) and [`cacheLife`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife.md) control caching exactly where you need it
* **Streaming stays**: Use `<Suspense>` or a `loading.(js|tsx)` file to stream dynamic parts while the shell shows immediately
* **Beyond `fetch`**: Using the `use cache` directive caching can be applied to all server IO (database calls, APIs, computations), not just `fetch`. Nested `fetch` calls won't silently flip an entire route because behavior is governed by explicit cache boundaries and `Suspense`

## Examples

### Dynamic APIs

When accessing runtime APIs like `cookies()`, Next.js will only pre-render the fallback UI above this component.

In this example, we have no fallback defined, so Next.js shows an error instructing us to provide one. The `<User />` component needs to be wrapped in `Suspense` because it uses the `cookies` API:

```jsx filename="app/user.js" switcher
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export async function User() {
  const session = (await cookies()).get('session')?.value
  return '...'
}
```

```tsx filename="app/user.tsx" switcher
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export async function User() {
  const session = (await cookies()).get('session')?.value
  return '...'
}
```

Now we have a `Suspense` boundary around our User component we can pre-render the Page with a Skeleton UI and stream in the `<User />` UI when a specific user makes a request

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { User, AvatarSkeleton } from './user'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This will be pre-rendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<AvatarSkeleton />}>
        <User />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { User, AvatarSkeleton } from './user'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This will be pre-rendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<AvatarSkeleton />}>
        <User />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```

### Passing dynamic props

Components that access runtime values like `cookies` or `searchParams` cannot be prerendered. To prerender more of a page's content, you can pass these props down and access their values lower in the tree. For example, if you are reading `searchParams` from a `<Page />` component, you can forward this value to another component as a prop:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Table, TableSkeleton } from './table'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams: Promise<{ sort: string }>
}) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This will be pre-rendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<TableSkeleton />}>
        <Table searchParams={searchParams.then((search) => search.sort)} />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Table, TableSkeleton } from './table'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page({ searchParams }) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This will be pre-rendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<TableSkeleton />}>
        <Table searchParams={searchParams.then((search) => search.sort)} />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```

Inside of the table component, accessing the value from `searchParams` will make the component dynamic while the rest of the page will be pre-rendered.

```tsx filename="app/table.tsx" switcher
export async function Table({ sortPromise }: { sortPromise: Promise<string> }) {
  const sort = (await sortPromise) === 'true'
  return '...'
}
```

```jsx filename="app/table.js" switcher
export async function Table({ sortPromise }) {
  const sort = (await sortPromise) === 'true'
  return '...'
}
```

## Route Handlers with Cache Components

`GET` Route Handlers follow the same model as normal UI routes in your application. They are dynamic by default, can be pre-rendered when deterministic, and you can `use cache` to include more dynamic data in the cached response.

Dynamic example, returns a different number for every request:

```tsx filename="app/api/random-number/route.ts"
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    randomNumber: Math.random(),
  })
}
```

A handler that returns only static data will be pre-rendered at build time:

```tsx filename="app/api/project-info/route.ts"
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    projectName: 'Next.js',
  })
}
```

If you had a route that returned fresh dynamic data on every request, say products from a database:

```tsx filename="app/api/products/route.ts"
export async function GET() {
  const products = await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')

  return Response.json(products)
}
```

To cache this and avoid hitting the database on every request, extract the dynamic work into a `use cache` function and set `cacheLife('hours')` so the database is queried at most once per hour:

```tsx filename="app/api/products/route.ts"
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export async function GET() {
  const products = await getProducts()

  return Response.json(products)
}

async function getProducts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')

  return await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')
}
```

> **Good to know**
>
> * `use cache` cannot be used directly inside a Route Handler body; extract to a helper.
> * Cached responses revalidate according to `cacheLife` when a new request arrives.
> * Using runtime APIs like [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies.md) or [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers.md), or calling [`connection()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection.md), always defers to request time (no pre-rendering).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this replace Partial Prerendering (PPR)?

No. Cache Components **implements** PPR as a feature. The old experimental PPR flag has been removed but PPR is here to stay.

PPR provides the static shell and streaming infrastructure; `use cache` lets you include optimized dynamic output in that shell when beneficial.

### What should I cache first?

What you cache should be a function of what you want your UI loading states to be. If data doesn't depend on runtime data and you're okay with a cached value being served for multiple requests over a period of time, use `use cache` with `cacheLife` to describe that behavior.

For content management systems with update mechanisms, consider using tags with longer cache durations and rely on `revalidateTag` to mark static initial UI as ready for revalidation. This pattern allows you to serve fast, cached responses while still updating content when it actually changes, rather than expiring the cache preemptively.

### How do I update cached content quickly?

Use [`cacheTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag.md) to tag your cached data, then trigger [`updateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag.md) or [`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag.md).
